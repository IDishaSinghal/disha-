<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Disha, a second-year B.Tech student with an unquenchable curiosity for technology and innovation. My journey through the realms of computer science, electronics, and mechanical systems has been nothing short of exhilarating. Each project and assignment has been a stepping stone, sharpening my problem-solving skills and deepening my appreciation for the intricate principles driving modern technology.</p>

<p>Beyond the classroom, I'm all about getting my hands dirty with real-world projects. Whether I'm developing a cutting-edge app, designing a robotic system, or diving into the fast-paced world of hackathons, I thrive on turning ideas into tangible results. These experiences have not only boosted my technical prowess but also underscored the power of teamwork, creativity, and sheer perseverance.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding or tinkering with gadgets, you'll find me lost in the pages of a book or crafting verses of poetry. Reading and writing are my gateways to different worlds, and I can't wait to share my musings with you. Stay tuned for the poetry page I’ll be adding soon! My ultimate goal? To blend my technical skills and creative passions into innovative solutions that make a meaningful impact.
